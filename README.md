# C++ Coursework
Here is my coursework from my third year of university. I was tasked with six numerical computing questions. I had to learn the six concepts all from the mathematics field and 
apply them to C++ in order to find and explain the solutions. I wanted to highlight my C++ knowledge here as I was awarded 99% on this coursework.
